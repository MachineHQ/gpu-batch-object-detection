# GPU-Accelerated Object Detection

This repository provides a complete, automated example of performing GPU-accelerated object detection using the DETR model (`facebook/detr-resnet-50`) and GitHub Actions powered by Machine.dev. It leverages Hugging Face Transformers to detect and annotate objects from images in the COCO2017 dataset.

### ✨ **Key Features**

- **⚡ GPU Acceleration:** Efficiently perform object detection using GPUs via Machine.dev.
- **📥 Seamless Data Integration:** Automatically fetch metadata and images from the `phiyodr/coco2017` dataset.
- **🔍 Automated Detection Pipeline:** Detect, annotate, and export results without manual intervention.
- **📂 Results in CSV:** Generate a structured CSV artifact with detection details for easy review.
- **🚀 Easy Deployment:** Use this repository as a GitHub template to quickly start your own GPU-accelerated workflows.

### ▶️ **Getting Started**

#### 1. **Use This Repository as a Template**
Click the **Use this template** button at the top of this page to create your own copy.

#### 2. **Set Up GPU Runners**
Ensure your repository uses Machine GPU-powered runners. No additional configuration is required if you're already using Machine.dev.

#### 3. **Run the Workflow**
- Trigger via commit or manually using GitHub Actions (**workflow_dispatch**).
- The workflow downloads and processes the first 1000 images from COCO2017.

You can run the benchmarking workflow manually via GitHub Actions using the workflow_dispatch trigger. This allows you to input parameters such as the tenancy you wish to use:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      tenancy:
        type: choice
        required: false
        description: 'The tenancy of the machine'
        default: 'spot'
        options:
          - 'spot'
          - 'on_demand'
```
These inputs are configurable directly in the GitHub Actions UI when manually triggering the workflow.


The workflow itself is fairly routine:

```yaml
jobs:
  detect_objects:
    name: Detect Objects
    runs-on:
      - machine
      - gpu=T4
      - cpu=4
      - ram=16
      - architecture=x64
      - tenancy=${{ inputs.tenancy }}
    steps:

      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python 3.10
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run Object Detection
        run: python3 object_detection.py

      - name: Upload Detection Results CSV
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: detection-results-csv
          path: detection_output/detections.csv

```
We have configured the detect_objects job to run on a Machine GPU runner with the desired specs.The workflow then installs dependencies, runs the object detection script, and uploads the resulting CSV as an artifact.


#### 4. **Review Outputs**
- Annotated images and `detections.csv` will be saved in the `detection_output/` directory.
- The CSV file is uploaded as a GitHub Actions artifact for convenient access.
